Take a pack of oreo and put 5-6 oreos in a cup.
Next, pour 2ml of milk in the same cup.
oreo's become soft and now we have to crumple the oreo's and maqke a choclaty paste.
Next, microwave the cup until a solid layer is made on the top.
take the cake out and carefully put it in a bowl as it could be hot.
to decorate it, drizzle some sprinkles onto it.
enjoy your awesome creation.
